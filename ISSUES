* Launcher login window obscures sync progress on OS X.
* A600 always gets an RTC, even a stock one.
* Should A1200 with expanded memory use MSM6242B or RP5C01A?
* A1200 model uses KS 3.0 not KS 3.1 by default.
* When starting FS-UAE from FS-UAE Launcher, accelerator flashs ROM writes
  are not persistent because the launcher uses a new copy every time.
* On OS X, cursor movement is currently not received by FS-UAE when the
  window is not focused (either something SDL 2 or OS X itself does). This
  makes mouse integration a bit less useful.
