# Installing

There are several ways of installing FS-UAE. You can use one of the officially supported methods:

- Use one of the [ready-made packages](https://fs-uae.net/alpha) for Windows, Linux and macOS.
- Use official packages built for your specific Linux distribution via [OBS repositories](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=home%3AFrodeSolheim&package=fs-uae-5)

Or you can get FS-UAE via third parties (unsupported) or [build it yourself] FIXME link.

Depending on your needs, you might also want to install some [Plugins](plugins.md).
