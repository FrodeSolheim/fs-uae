COMMON QUESTIONS

Q. Can I include the IPF DECODER LIBRARY with my product?
A. No. The IPF DECODER LIBRARY is not licensed for commercial use. Using IPF DECODER LIBRARY as a "freebie" or including it at "no cost" with your product still constitutes commerical usage and is forbidden by the licence.

Q. Can I sell my product with the IPF DECODER LIBRARY or associated logos (e.g. SPS) on it?
A. No. Putting the name or logo on your product makes it appear that the product is something officially endorsed.

Q. Can I use the IPF DECODER LIBRARY or the SPS logo to advertise my product?
A. No. Using the name or logo in your advertising makes it appear that the product is something officially endorsed.

Q. Can I use the term "IPF DECODER LIBRARY" in the name of my software?
A. Generally, no, especially if it is something that is sold. However, if you are producing a free IPF DECODER LIBRARY-related piece of software, it is common that permission is granted. Send a query to double-check first, please.

Q. Can I ask for donations for the work I did on my port of IPF DECODER LIBRARY to platform X?
A. No. You would be earning money from the IPF DECODER LIBRARY trademark and copyrights, and that would be a commercial use, which is prohibited by the licence. It is our wish that IPF DECODER LIBRARY remains free.
