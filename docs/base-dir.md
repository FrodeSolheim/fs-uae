# Base directory

The so-called base directory is the place where FS-UAE stores its files. By
default, this location is `Documents/FS-UAE` or `$HOME/FS-UAE` depending on the
FS-UAE version and your system. It it possible to change this location to
something else.

See [directories.md] for more information.

If you use the portable version, the base directory is the same as the portable
directory (the directory containing Portable.ini).
