Description: "Grab keyboard when input is grabbed"
Default: 1
Example: 0
Since: 2.3.10
Type: boolean

Set this option to 0 to prevent input grab from also grabbing the keyboard,
only the mouse will then be grabbed. This only works when FS-UAE uses
SDL2. By default, both mouse and keyboard input will be grabbed together.
