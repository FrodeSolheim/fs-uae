Description: "Render scan lines"
Default: 0
Example: 1
Type: boolean

Enable scanlines by setting scanlines to 1. The default is 0. When scanlines
are enabled, you will see aliasing effects if your resolution is low (and
in window mode). Use fullscreen mode with sufficient resolution and the
scanlines effect should look good. There will also be a visible moire
pattern when entering menu mode (this is normal). Scanline rendering is
done on the CPU, and this may negatively impact emulation speed if you do
not have a sufficiently fast CPU.
