* Menu font re-drawn a bit smaller and thinner.
* Use only older OpenGL features, should work fine on OpenGL 1.4/1.5
  implementations now (possibly also OpenGL 1.1).

* FS-UAE can open configuration files without (-c) parameter, makes FS-UAE.
  easier to start with config from graphical shells (Windows Explorer,
  Mac OS X Finder).
* Added chip_memory, fast_memory and slow_memory options (see example.conf).
* Fixed bug where save states would not be saved if floppies where specified
  with absolute path.
* Fixed problem with opening CUE files on systems other than Windows.
* Fixed audio buffering issues.
* Buffer additional audio data on buffer underrun before resuming playback.
* Fixed problem with renaming files in virtual (mounted) disks on Windows.
* Code cleanup in libamiga, new wrapper functions for some platform-specific
  code.
* Support for large HDF files (> 2GB) (untested, and not supported on Windows
  yet).
* Better implementation of write_log in libamiga.
* Updated README to clarify that you can use ALT+F11 on Mac to toggle mouse
  pointer (since the OS intercepts F11 alone).
* Write information about base WinUAE version to log file.
* Use same random number generator on all platforms.

Version 0.9.6:

 * Support for hard drive images (hdf)
 * Support for mounting virtual folders as hard drives (experimental)
 * Bugfix in calculation of save location of overlay adf files
 * UTF-8 is now used internally in libamiga also on Windows, and
   text is converted to other character sets / encodings as needed.
   This enables support for non-ASCII characters in paths on Windows.
 * Added a copyright notice at startup crediting the original WinUAE,
   E-UAE and PUAE authors, and added a more prominent notice in the start
   of the README.

Version 0.9.5:

 * Added support for A500+ and A600 models
 * Video sync behaviour can now be overriden from config or command line
   (see example.conf)
 * New --video-sync command line parameter (auto/off/vblank/full)
 * Old --vsync parameter is gone
 * Fixed threading related bug which cased OpenAL output to stop
 * Added a PID controller implementation for automatic audio buffer management
   (small pitch adjustments are carefully made to keep the buffer from
   getting to small or too large).

Version 0.9.4:

 * CD audio support for CDTV/CD32
 * Audio output is now using OpenAL
 * CDTV/CD32 now works properly when specifying kickstart files manually
 * Link with libdl on Linux systems

Version 0.9.3:

 * Configuration option to keep the aspect when scaling the screen (see
   example.conf)
 * README: added information about supporting new controllers
 * example.conf: documented the kickstart_ext_file option
 * FS-UAE compiles on Linux 64-bit now

Version 0.9.2:

 * Fixed a crash occuring when swapping floppy disks
 * Fixed problem with parent dirs not being created, preventing logging
 * Created and added scripts/makefiles to create binary distributions for
   Windows and Mac OS X (debian files were already added)
 * Add example.conf, README, COPYING and licence files to all distributions
 * Source distribution is now patched for 64-bit support

Version 0.9.1:

 * Add Mac OS X-specific Makefile to build an app bundle
 * Also map right alt key to emulated joystick (for Mac OS X)
 * Fix compilation of libcapsimage on Mac OS X
 * Support for several more gamepad devices
