Summary: Add shared volume
Type: Boolean
Default: 0
Example: 1

FIXME: TODO: Implement support for this

Enable this option to automatically add a shared volume (`Shared:`) to the
emulated Amiga. This is a directory hard drive and will also enable the UAE boot
ROM.

The volume will be added after all other hard drives. Therefore, the device
name (DHx:) can change if you add other drives. The recommended way to access
this volume is by using the volume name `Shared:`.
