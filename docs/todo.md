# FS-UAE to-do file

This document is not an exhaustive list of things to do. Please consider
it a partial list of things that might happen to FS-UAE soon or in the
future.

- Revisit / set up default shortcuts for state loading/saving.
- Revisit / set up default shortcuts for floppy selection/insertion.

- Move stuff from other to-do lists to this document :p

In progress:

- On-screen keyboard suitable for use with controllers with realistic system-specific keyboards.

To-do:

- GUI rendering is not optimized yet, GUI element textures are created for
  each frame and not reused. Could affect performance on slower systems.
- Monitor selection does not work
- CD audio does not work
- Themes are not implemented yet
- Some video scaling options may have no effect yet
- Some video and audio options may have no effect right now
  (for example GPU texture format or audio frequency).
- Net play support is not ready yet
- Support for multiple mice is not ready yet
- Joystick support may be limited to gamepad-like devices initially
- Support controlling the GUI with the mouse.

Probably:

- Built-in file browser with controller support (mainly for floppy selection), an oft-requested feature.

Other bonuses:

- Make it easier to specify (any) actions on game controllers in ports, independent of controller type but dependent on port mode. (e.g. port0_joy_lefttrigger = action_quit)
- Custom names and automatic screenshots for save states.

Done:

- Better audio subsystem with lower audio latency.
- Make better use of high-resolution timers to ensure the emulation runs smoothly also in fastest-possible CPU mode.
- Support hot-plugging game controllers.
- Create a better architecture which makes it easier to support different audio and video backends. Initial version with ALSA and SDL2 audio backends, and OpenGL and SDL2 video backends.
- Ensure that FS-UAE works really well with G-SYNC and FreeSync monitors on supported systems.
- Better internal book-keeping and visual graphs of performance and timing, to make it easier to identify issues and make sure the emulation runs smoothly.
- Truetype font rendering for better readability and internationalization.
- Better support for high-DPI displays.
- Make the user interface adapt better to non-16:9 displays.
- Make (lib)FSEMU better suitable for integration with different emulators.
