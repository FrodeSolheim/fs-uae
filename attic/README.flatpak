For OpenGL, we need --device=dri. But using all for controllers. Ideally,
there would be a better way to give access to joysticks. Also, this only
works for controllers connected before starting the app.

Maybe we can mount the entire dev or something to get hotplugging working?

Sounds like the future is inputfd...
