# Notes for macOS users

## Access to folders

In recent macOS versions, the operating system will ask if you want to give
FS-UAE / FS-UAE Launcher / FS-UAE Arcade access to your Documents folder. If
you answer no to this question, FS-UAE will fail to start, and you will not
get the question again. In this case, go to "System Preferences" ->
"Security & Privacy" -> "Privacy" tab -> "Files and Folders" and check the
box(es) giving FS-UAE access to "Documents Folder".

## Fullscreen spaces

Fullscreen mode does not use an OS X fullscreen spaces by default, but you
can enable this with the following environment variable:

    SDL_VIDEO_MAC_FULLSCREEN_SPACES = 1

You can specify this in FS-UAE Launcher Settings: Advanced Settings.
Remember to write it as shown above in all caps.

## Input monitoring

In order to see individual mouse devices, you may have to go to 
Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Input Monitoring, and allow access
for FS-UAE, FS-UAE Launcher and FS-UAE Arcade.
