Set to enable to enable autofire for this joystick port.

Enabling autofire for a joystick port means that the ordinary fire
button will give the effect of many rapid-fire short presses. If you
need to generate a combination of long and rapid-fire presses of the
fire button, then instead of enabling this setting, you can instead
configure a different keystroke or controller button to map to
‘action_joy_0_autofire_button’.
