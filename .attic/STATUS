# Status

In general, the focus has been to make the core functionality better, i.e. to
create a better foundation for FS-UAE going forward. This means that right
now, FS-UAE it less configurable (*) than before, but also hopefully works
better out of the box.

(*) Amiga emulation-related options are still support. Only host options such
as display, input and audio options are affected by this.

If you want to try, please make sure to read the section "Things you cannot do
right now" If there are any deal-breakers there for you, you might want to
wait.

## Notable changes

- Rewritten video/audio/input system. Should be easier to understand and
  extend with new features (at least for me).
- Includes support for hotpluggable devices.
- Can be more easily extended with other audio/video drivers (such as using
  ALSA directly), but current version uses SDL for audio and SDL+OpenGL for
  video.
- Making better use of high-resolution timers to ensure the emulation runs
  smoothly also in fastest-possible CPU mode. This allows for v-sync in
  fastest possible mode and emulated CPU cycle count is much more stable.
- Audio latency can also generally be lower due to timing improvements.
- FS-UAE should work better with G-SYNC and FreeSync monitors.
- New GUI look all over (not complete yet).
- Truetype font rendering for better readability and internationalization.
- Make the user interface adapt better to non-16:9 displays.
- Better support for high-DPI displays.
- New standard bezel which tries to frame the 4:3 output while being pleasant.
- New on-screen LEDs by default.
- New On-screen keyboard (F11 or SELECT to toggle) - Visual look not done yet.
- New performance overlay (Alt/Cmd+O) which makes it easier to identify
  performance issues.
- Much improved support for Raspberry Pi 4.
- Replaced QEMU-UAE-based slirp with latest libslirp from QEMU, and also
  fixed a race condition causing crash or corrupt data transfer. This improves
  the stabiliy of the A2065 emulation.
- Integrated MIDI output support via portmidi (tested on Linux). Can use to
  for example play Sierra games with an external MT-32 emulator.
- Updated emulation code from WinUAE 4.2.1. Allows for use of UAE expansions
  with AmigaOS 4.1 (for example directory hard drives). Also enabled
  x86 bridgeboard emulation (tested and works, not officially supported yet).

## Issues and things you cannot do right now!

Video:

- Only a fixed viewport / zoom is support for now.
- Scaling / zoom options do not have any effect yet.
- No shader support, only bilinear filtering (always on).
- No support for themes right now.
- Monitor selection does not work.

Audio:

- Audio buffer size and output frequency is not configurable right now.
- CD audio does not work.

Input:

- Input mapping is not configurable at this time.
- Most input-related options will have no effect at this point.
- Not using Raw input on Windows right now; some keys may not be intercepted
  properly on Windows for full keyboard emulation.
- Support for multiple mice is not ready yet.
- Joystick support may be limited to gamepad-like devices right now.

Other:

- Translations not supported at this time.
- Net play support is not ready yet.
- GUI rendering is not optimized yet, GUI element textures are created for
  each frame and not reused. This can negatively affect performance on slower
  systems when GUI elements are shown on-screen.

## Raspberry Pi 4

- Efficiency improvements related to rendering makes FS-UAE run better on the RPI4.
- Official build supports running under both X11 and in console (KMSDRM).
- Requires FKMS / experimental OpenGL support to be enabled on the Raspberry Pi.
- Automatically switches to 1920x1080p @50Hz if the mode is available.
- Overclocking to 2 Ghz is recommended (that's what I've been testing with).
- Make sure the RPI4 can run cool enough constantly without throttling the CPU;
  An active/passive cooling solution - or a Raspberry Pi 400 is recommended.
- Run `sudo cpufreq-set -g performance` to make sure all cores run at full speed
  while FS-UAE is running (install with `sudo apt install cpufrequtils`).
